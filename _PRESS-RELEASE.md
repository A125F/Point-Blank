# Point Blank #
***Go and get your point across.***
Point Blank is a platform that bluntly reflects how the general populace feels about public figures. 

## Overview ##
Point Blank aims to crowdsource public opinion to better understand how society perceives today's 
Persons of Influence (POI). POI include but are not limited to celebrities, political/religious
figures, scholars, and more. POI are not necessarily positive influences on society. Their status as 
well-known public figures means their actions can always be readily scrutinized. Point Blank strives to 
recognize POI who have made a positive impact to make the world a better place, and at the same time, 
condemn those who undermine the integrity of being in such a spotlight. Dishonesty, scandals, bigotry, 
corruption, and so on are the triggers that turn a POI into a POS (Piece of S***).

## Problem ##
Persons of Influence are celebrated for their contributions to society and condemned for their gross misconduct. 
However, both celebration and condemnation have become exceedingly fleeting. While the story of uncovering a CEO's
corruption may circulate the news for a week, a philanthropist's generous donation to a worthy cause would
hardly survive even two days in the violent rapids of media consumption.

## Solution ##
Point Blank serves as a record of public opinion for POI. As time trudges along, their past will remain 
etched Point Blank on an indifferent slab. Actions, both great and wicked, are archived. What this means for every 
Person of Influence is that it would take only a simple glance to see significant peaks and troughs in public opinion
and the POI's according actions that caused such changes. It is Point Blank's hope that this platform will improve the 
accountability and integrity of POI through the help of public opinion. 

## Quote ##
"There are three types of people in the world: you're either a POI, a POS, or a person with no POIPOS."

## How to Get Started ##
Simply provide your input on how you feel about a POI. Along the way, learn about a POI's past and see 
how that influences your views. It is easy to be swept away in the tides of popular opinion today, but it is 
infinitely more valuable to truly learn and form an opinion you can call your own. Remember, a person's life
doesn't only have one chapter.
