# Point Blank

Point Blank aims to crowdsource public opinion to better understand how society perceives today's 
Persons of Influence (POI). POI include but are not limited to celebrities, political/religious
figures, scholars, and more. POI are not necessarily positive influences on society. Their status as 
well-known public figures means their actions can always be readily scrutinized. Point Blank strives to 
recognize POI who have made a positive impact to make the world a better place, and at the same time, 
condemn those who undermine the integrity of being in such a spotlight. Dishonesty, scandals, bigotry, 
corruption, and so on are the triggers that turn a POI into a POS (Piece of S***).
